This is a collection of notes and code snippets I am using to see data structure and algorithms through the lens of F#.

## Warning: Learning project
This is a learning project and I do not expect this to ever be used by others. Therefore, codes may change, tests may be absent, wikis may be lazily written or contain swear words.
